Fashion Store E-Commerce UI is a Flutter-based mobile app nga among gihim. It offers a simple and smooth shopping experience, focused on eco-friendly fashion. We used Provider for managing state and cached image loading para paspas ug responsive ang app. Medyo lisod ang pag-handle sa null safety labi na sa cart part, most of the codes and buttons are working if you click one of the products the price and the description will pop up the same as the other items inside the mobile app but sad to say the cart is not working we did our best but yeps we cant solve it and also we dont have enough time to solve due to lack of resources and time but in the end we still made it, we made something memorable, the hardwork the sleepless nights and most of all we learned a lot of lessons specially in temawork because I believe in 
"Team work will make the dream work"
